This is a very simple Forth for sh3 that uses dumb, honest to god
indirect threaded code.  The core is written entirely in assembler.
There are only three environmental dependencies for now - printing one
char (EMIT), printing a buffer (TYPE) and reading an input line
(ACCEPT).  Escape to C is also used for things like 64-bit division
(rewriting __divmoddi4 in asm from scratch is boring and kinda
pointless).

The core of the interpreter for sh3 is 16 instructions.  About 70 asm
words tally up to about 500 instructions.  Nearly all of them are
short trivial sequences, like adding two numbers, etc.  I'd say that
someone familiar with the target ISA can port == write the asm core in
an evening or two.  The rest of the system is in manually "compiled"
threaded code.
